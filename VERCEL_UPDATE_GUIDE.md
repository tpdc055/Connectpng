   JWT_SECRET=your-jwt-secret
   ```
3. **Add if missing**:
   ```bash
   # Required for universal system
   JWT_SECRET=your-super-secure-32-character-secret
   SESSION_SECRET=your-session-secret

   # Optional
   NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY=your-api-key
   ```

### **Step 5: Redeploy After Environment Changes**

## 🎉 Test Your Updated System

### **Step 1: Visit Your Live URL**
- **Go to your Vercel project URL**
- **Should be**: `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`

### **Step 2: What You Should See**

## ⚙️ Database Considerations

### **If Using Same Database:**

- ✅ **Enhanced features** - Financial tracking, incident reporting

### **If Database Issues:**
Check your Vercel project logs:
1. **Go to Functions tab**
2. **Click on any API function**
3. **Check for database connection errors**

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### **Build Fails:**
```bash
# Common causes and solutions:
1. Missing environment variables → Add to Vercel settings
2. Database connection issues → Check DATABASE_URL
3. Prisma client issues → Should auto-resolve in build
```

### **Deployment Shows Old System:**
```bash
# Solutions:
1. Hard refresh browser (Ctrl+F5)
2. Clear browser cache
3. Check deployment logs for errors
4. Manually redeploy from Vercel dashboard
```

### **Setup Wizard Doesn't Appear:**
```bash
# Check:
1. Database connected properly
2. SystemSettings table created
3. Clear browser cache
